    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we diagnosed a critical business problem: **monthly user retention plummets to a mere 2-6% after the first month**. We concluded this is a fundamental \"Failure to Activate,\" meaning users aren't experiencing the product's core value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook moves from diagnosis to **investigation**. Our goal is to test that \"Failure to Activate\" hypothesis by analyzing the core e-commerce conversion funnel. By mapping the user journey from viewing a product to making a purchase, we can pinpoint the *exact stage* where the vast majority of users drop off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our defined funnel is:\n",
    "1.  **View Product:** The user views an item.\n",
    "2.  **Add to Cart:** The user adds an item to their shopping cart.\n",
    "3.  **Purchase:** The user completes the purchase."

    "### 6. Investigation Findings and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "The funnel chart provides a stark and immediate answer to our investigation, validating our \"Failure to Activate\" hypothesis from Notebook 1. The data reveals two very different stories at each stage of the funnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The \"Discovery to Consideration\" Bottleneck:** The primary reason for our low retention is immediately obvious. Of all the user sessions that view a product, **only 8.4% proceed to add an item to their cart**. This means over 91% of user interest evaporates at this single step. This is the main leakage point in our entire user journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **High-Intent \"Consideration to Purchase\" Conversion:** In stark contrast, the conversion from `Cart` to `Purchase` is surprisingly strong at **50.3%**. This is a crucial insight: if we can get a user to demonstrate high intent by adding an item to their cart, they have a good chance of completing the purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Our investigation successfully pinpoints the root cause of the catastrophic 2-6% retention we diagnosed. The problem is not that users are abandoning their carts in large numbers; **the core problem is that the vast majority of users never even begin the purchasing process.** They look at products but fail to take the crucial next step of adding to the cart, which is the true start of the activation journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "We've established a clear chain of logic:\n",
    "- Low retention is caused by a fundamental activation failure.\n",
    "- This activation failure is caused by a massive 91.6% drop-off between viewing a product and adding it to a cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final, critical question is: **what separates the 8.4% of sessions that succeed from the 91.6% that fail?** What behaviors or user characteristics are predictive of a user successfully starting their cart?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next notebook, **`03_Insight_Interpretable_Modeling.ipynb`**, will build a model to answer this question, giving us the final insight needed to design a powerful, data-driven solution."
